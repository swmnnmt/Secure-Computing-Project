## G.Vernam Encryption

### Usage of the Vernam cipher

Vernam is symmetrical stream cipher which was originally invented by Gilbert Vernam in 1917 
In the Vernam Cipher an alphanumeric plaintext is combined with a chosen alphanumeric key-text to generate a ciphertext. This combination results from shifting each character of the plaintext cyclically by the corresponding value of the keytext-character. So if e.g. the plaintext is "a" and the keytext "c" and our alphabet is the basic one from a-z, the character "a" would be shifted by 3 and result into "d"    
We are putting the plaintext –  `THE SECURE COMPUTING PROJECT AND G.VERNAM CIPHER`

So, when we press the encrypt button, we will get the Ciphertext  – `SOF UBUYIX WWWBHUDTZ JZCUOOG VTI F.CFEICP GHWIZT`
