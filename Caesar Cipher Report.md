## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a very basic substitution cipher – each letter is replaced by another. It also includes an offset that determines how many letters away from the original the substituted letter would be. So, for instance, if the offset were 2, A would become C and W would become Y.

Here is a screenshot of CrypTool 2.0 set up to do a Caeser cipher with offset 25.

You can see the message Notice that the offset (key) is 25. You can see that the “T” in “This” became “S” as I noted above.

Here is the decryption of that scrambled message.

Of course, this isn’t very strong at all. In fact, it is easily broken by knowing the structure of the language, which in this case is English. That wouldn’t help much for such a small message, but a larger one might be easier. Trial and error would work quickly, too.
